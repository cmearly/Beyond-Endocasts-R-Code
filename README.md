# Beyond-Endocasts-R-Code
R code used to run the analyses published in Early et al. 2020 Beyond endocasts

"BayesModelS_v24.R" - This is the version of BayesModelS (Nunn and Zhu, 2014) used in the analyses in this publication.


The following R scripts should be used, in order and as indicated by annotations within the script, to run analyses on optic tectum and optic lobe size.

"Early et al 2020 - Optic Lobe Optic Tectum - Step 1 Fossil Predictions.R" - This is the code for predicting optic tectum volume in extinct birds based on optic lobe surface area using BayesModelS (Nunn and Zhu, 2014).
"Early et al 2020 - Optic Lobe Optic Tectum - Step 2 Fossil Merging.R" - This is the code for incorporating fossils into datasets for use in the previous script.
"Early et al 2020 - Optic Lobe Optic Tectum - Step 3 phyANCOVAs.R" - This is the code for using the R package evomap (Smaers and Mongle, 2014) to test for differences in the optic tectum volumes of fossils predicted in the previous scripts with BayesModelS.


The following R scripts should be used, in order and as indicated by annotations within the script, to run analyses on hyperpallium and Wulst size.

"Early et al 2020 - Wulst Hyperpallium - Step 1 Fossil Predictions.R" - This is the code for predicting hyperpallium volume in extinct birds based on Wulst surface area using BayesModelS (Nunn and Zhu, 2014).
"Early et al 2020 - Wulst Hyperpallium - Step 2 Fossil Merging.R" - This is the code for incorporating fossils into datasets for use in the previous script.
"Early et al 2020 - Wulst Hyperpallium - Step 3 phyANCOVAs.R" - This is the code for using the R package evomap (Smaers and Mongle, 2014) to test for differences in the hyperpallium volumes of fossils predicted in the previous scripts with BayesModelS.
